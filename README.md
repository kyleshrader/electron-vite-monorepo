# electron-vite-monorepo

## Overview
This repository demonstrates a minimal configuration monorepo using yarn with electron-vite, TypeScript, and React. It's based on the @quick-start/electron template, showcasing the core functionalities of electron-vite in a monorepo setup.

Another goal of this repository was to break each component of the @quick-start/electron template out into it's own package to demonstrate how each would need to be reconfigured to work.

## Minimal Configuration
⚠️ Note: This setup doesn't include all configurations and scripts from the quick-start template.

Consider adding:
- ESLint and Prettier for code quality and formatting.
- Version constraints for cross-package dependencies.
- Monorepo management tools (e.g., NX, Lerna, Turbo).
- Early build typechecking and enhanced tsconfig settings.

## Additional Tools (Optional)
You may also explore integrating:
- Testing with Jest.
- UI development with Storybook.
- UI libraries like Tailwind, Material-UI, Chakra UI, etc.
